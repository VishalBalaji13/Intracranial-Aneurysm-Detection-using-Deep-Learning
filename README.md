# Intracranial-Aneurysm-Detection-using-Deep-Learning

Effective brain aneurysm detection with high accuracy is vital for timely medical intervention, yet existing methods often struggle with precision and reliability. To overcome these challenges, we developed a hybrid deep learning approach that integrates Mesh CNN for segmentation and detection. The Mesh CNN algorithm effectively processes 3D volumetric data from MRI or CT scans, performing accurate segmentation of aneurysms by capturing the complex shape of blood vessels and aneurysms. The model then detects and localizes aneurysms within the segmented regions with high precision. This combined approach provides a significant advancement in automated aneurysm detection, potentially enhancing diagnostic accuracy, treatment planning, and patient outcomes in the medical field.
